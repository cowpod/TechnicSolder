>TechnicSolder is an API that sits between a modpack repository and the Technic Launcher. It allows you to easily manage multiple modpacks in one single location.

>Using Solder also means your packs will download each mod individually. This means the launcher can check MD5's against each version of a mod and if it hasn't changed, use the cached version of the mod instead. What does this mean? Small incremental updates to your modpack doesn't mean redownloading the whole thing every time!

>Solder also interfaces with the Technic Platform using an API key you can generate through your account there. When Solder has this key it can directly interact with your Platform account. When creating new modpacks you will be able to import any packs you have registered in your Solder install. It will also create detailed mod lists on your Platform page! (assuming you have the respective data filled out in Solder) Neat huh?

TechnicSolder was originaly developed by Technic using the Laravel Framework. However, the application is difficult to install and use. Technic Solder - Solder.cf by TheGameSpider runs on pure PHP with zip and MySQL extensions and it's very easy to use. To install, you just need to install zip extension, setup MySQL database and download Solder to your server (No composer needed). And the usage is even easier! Just Drag n' Drop your mods.

## Installation and configuration (without SSH/CLI access)
If you are using a shared host, or for some reason don't have access to the command-line interface, the general set-up is as follows. This assumes you'll be using something like cPanel.

- Set PHP version to 8.3. 
- Install the PHP ZIP, PDO extensions.
    - Enable one or both of pdo_mysql, pdo_sqlite 
- In Apache2 settings, enable rewriteengine, and the PHP module.
- Upload the contents of this git to your document root, such that index.php is directly in your document root folder. This is usually in ``/var/www/html``
    - Alternatively, you can modify the document root in cPanel to point to the folder containing this repository. Ie. ``/var/www/html/TechnicSolder``
- Using phpMyAdmin, or any built-in cPanel MySQL editor, Create a new user ``solder``, database ``solder``, and grant the user access to the database. Make sure you write down your password.

Now open your server address, ie. ``http://localhost`` if running on a your local machine, and follow the set-up prompt there. 
- If using MySQL, set the user of the database to ``solder``, database name to ``solder``, host to either ``localhost`` (if the database is on the same machine and network as the web server) or the IP address of your database, and the password you created earlier. 
- If using SQLite, simply set the type to SQLite.
- For the Solder API key, go to [https://technicpack.net](https://technicpack.net), log in/create an account, go to my settings/profile, and click on "solder" on the left menu.

## Detailed Installation (SSH/CLI access required)
> ***Note: If you already have a working web server with PDO and ZIP extensions and enabled rewrite mod, you can [skip to step 6.](#cloning-technicsolder-repository)***

**1. Install Ubuntu Server (https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server)** <br />
**2. Login to Ubuntu with credentials you set.** <br />
**3. Become root**
Root is basically the "god account" that controls everything on the system.
You should never, _EVER_ use root to do simple tasks, unless you want your computer to be destroyed.
```bash
sudo su -
``` 

**4. Install Prerequisites**<br />
This command installs what's known as a LAMP Stack, which includes Apache2, MariaDB, and PHP. Very useful!
```bash
apt update
```
Then install the packages
```
apt -y install mariadb-server apache2 libapache2-mod-php php8.3 php8.3-pdo php8.3-zip libzip-dev
```
...Or the following if you intend to only use sqlite
```
apt -y install apache2 libapache2-mod-php php8.3 php8.3-pdo php8.3-zip libzip-dev
```

Then, restart apache.
```bash
service apache2 restart
```

We're now going to test that Apache and PHP are working together. Open up a blank file:
```
nano /var/www/html/index.php
```
and put the following text, inside:
```php
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
```
Save and close the file. (``Ctrl-X, y, Enter``)

Now we can test whether our web server can correctly display content generated by a PHP script. To try this out, we just have to visit this page in our web browser. You'll need your server's public IP address. If you haven't already, and need to, remember to port forward port 80 (TCP).
```bash
curl http://icanhazip.com
```
Open in your web browser: `http://your_server_IP_address` \
This page basically gives you information about your PHP Compiler. It is useful for debugging and to ensure that your settings are being applied correctly. 

Now look for the following to enable PHP extensions

1. Look for 'PDO Drivers' under **PDO**. If you don't have sqlite, mysql, you will also need to enable extensions ``pdo_mysql``, ``pdo_sqlite`` (or just one of the sql extensions depending on your use) in your php.ini file.
2. Look for 'Zip' under **zip**. It should be enabled. If it isn't you'll need to enable the ``zip`` extension in your php.ini file.
3. Also look for 'Loaded Configuration File'. It should look something like ``/usr/local/etc/php/php.ini``. 

If you don't have a file here and it's instead blank, look for 'Configuration File (php.ini) Path', and append ``/php.ini`` to that path.
- For example, ``/usr/local/etc/php`` would become ``/usr/local/etc/php/php.ini``

Now that you have your php.ini path, open it in your editor
```
nano /usr/local/etc/php/php.ini
```
And uncomment (remove ``;`` at the beginning of the line) the following, or add (without the comments) if a blank file:
```
;extension=zip
;extension=pdo_sqlite
;extension=pdo_mysql
```
Save and close the file. (``Ctrl-X, y, Enter``)

(max_execution_time, post_max_size, and upload_max_file_size are already set in .user.ini and .htaccess.)

Save and close the file. (``Ctrl-X, y, Enter``)

Now restart apache2.
```
service apache2 restart
```

Reload your site. The PHP info page should now display ``Zip enabled``, and ``PDO drivers sqlite,mysql``.

You probably want to remove this file after this test because it could actually give information about your server to unauthorized users. To do this, you can type
```bash
rm /var/www/html/index.php
```
**5. Enable RewriteEngine and Configure Apache**<br />
```bash
a2enmod rewrite
cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/TechnicSolder.conf
a2ensite TechnicSolder
nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/TechnicSolder.conf
```

Add the following above the `DocumentRoot` line:
```
ServerName <yourSolderDomainHere>
```

Change the `DocumentRoot` line to:
```
DocumentRoot /var/www/TechnicSolder
```

Add this before `</VirtualHost>` close tag:
```
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html
    <Directory /var/www/TechnicSolder>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
```
Save and close the file and restart Apache:
```
service apache2 restart
```

**6. Clone TechnicSolder repository** 
```bash
cd /var/www/
git clone https://github.com/TheGameSpider/TechnicSolder.git TechnicSolder
```
Installation is complete. Now you need to configure TechnicSolder before using it

**If you are using nginx:**  

Here is an incomplete example for nginx configuration. For a complete (but unrelated) example, see [https://nginx.org/en/docs/example.html](https://nginx.org/en/docs/example.html). 
 ```nginx
location / {
    try_files   $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

location /api/ {
    try_files   $uri $uri/ /api/index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location ~* \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass                    unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index                   index.php;
        fastcgi_split_path_info         ^(.+\.php)(.*)$;
        include                         fcgi.conf;
        fastcgi_param PATH_INFO         $fastcgi_path_info;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME   $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

    location ~ .*/\. {
        return 403;
    }

# block access to sqlite database file
location = ~* /db\.sqlite$ {
            deny all;
}
error_page 403 /403.html;

location ~* \.(?:ico|css|js|jpe?g|JPG|png|svg|woff)$ {
        expires 365d;
}
 ```
# Configuration
**Configure MySQL** (not applicable if you are using SQLite)
```bash
mysql
```
Login with your password you set earlier. <br />
Create new user
```MYSQL
CREATE USER 'solder'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secret';
```
> **NOTE: By writing *IDENTIFIED BY 'secret'* you set your password. Dont use *secret***

<br />

Create database solder and grant user *solder* access to it.

```MYSQL
CREATE DATABASE solder;
GRANT ALL ON solder.* TO 'solder'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

**Configure TechnicSolder** <br />

```bash
chown -R www-data TechnicSolder
```

Go to `http://your_server_IP_address` and fill out the form. If you followed these instructions, database name and username is `solder` <br />

The final step is to set your Solder URL in Solder Configuration (In your https://technicpack.net profile)

That's it. You have successfully installed and configured TechnicSolder. It's ready to use!

# Updating

1. Files/folders

- If you originally used `git clone` to get these files:
    - Simply run `git pull` in the cloned directory.
- Or if you used some other method like FTP:
    - Copy functions/config.php, forges, mods, others to a safe location
    - Delete all TechnicSolder-related files and folders in the location you installed TechnicSolder to. 
    - Re-upload the new TechnicSolder files. 
    - Then move config.php back to functions.

2. Database
- If you were previously on v1.3.4, open `http[s]://[your host name]/functions/upgrade1.3.5to1.4.0.php` in your web browser. 
- If you are on a version before 1.3.4, first update to v1.3.4, and then 1.4.0.
